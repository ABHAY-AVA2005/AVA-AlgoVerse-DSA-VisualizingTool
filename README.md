# 🌌 AVA-AlgoVerse — DSA Visualizer

### *Algorithm Visualization Architecture (AVA) // System v3.0 // Online*

**AVA (Algorithm Visualization Architecture)** is a high-precision, neo-futuristic platform designed to bridge the gap between **abstract data structures** and **human visual intuition**.
It delivers step-by-step algorithm execution, real-time performance insights, and immersive cyberpunk UI aesthetics tailored for deep technical understanding.

**Live Demo:**

## 📌 Key Highlights

* **Interactive DSA Visualizations** — High-fidelity rendering of memory blocks, nodes, and connections
* **Real-Time Execution Engine** — Step-by-step control with granular playback (target latency ~12ms)
* **Performance Analytics** — Live display of time-complexity intuition (Big-O, Ω, Θ during execution)
* **CPU Scheduling Simulator** — OS-level scheduling with dynamic Gantt charts
* **Graph & Pathfinding Engine** — Traversals and shortest-path visualization
* **Cyberpunk / Neo-Futuristic UI** — High-focus, command-center-style interface
* **Modern Frontend Architecture** — Built with production-grade tooling

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

AVA-AlgoVerse is built on the principle that:

**Visualizing abstraction reduces cognitive load and increases long-term retention.**

The cyberpunk theme is intentional—not decorative. It creates a high-focus, command-center-like environment similar to professional engineering dashboards, improving engagement and comprehension during complex algorithm execution.
